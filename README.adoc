=== Running standalone

If you just want to try it out, you can run it standalone:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -ti ghcr.io/gantsign/devcontainer-base
----

=== Running in VS Code

First you need to create a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in the root
of your project:

..devcontainer/devcontainer.json
[source,js]
----
// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json
{
	"name": "GantSign",
	"build": {
		"dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
	},

	"settings": {
		"editor.renderWhitespace": "all",
		"editor.rulers": [
			80,
			100,
			120
		],
		"editor.guides.bracketPairs": true
	},

	"extensions": [
		"streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker",
		"editorconfig.editorconfig"
	],

	"forwardPorts": [],

	"mounts": [
		"source=devcontainer-history,target=/home/dev/.shell_history,type=volume",
		"source=devcontainer-zoxide,target=/home/dev/.local/share/zoxide,type=volume"
	],

	"runArgs": [
		// [Optional] Uncomment for improved security, requires https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox to be installed
		// "--runtime=sysbox-runc"
	],

	"remoteUser": "dev",
}
----

Then you need to create a docker file:

..devcontainer/Dockerfile
[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM ghcr.io/gantsign/devcontainer-base

# ** [Optional] Uncomment this section to install additional packages. **
# RUN apt-get update && export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
#     && apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends <your-package-list-here>

# ** [Optional] Uncomment this section to install SDKs. **
# SHELL [ "/usr/bin/bash", "--login", "-c" ]
# RUN sdk_install java 11
# RUN sdk_install maven 3
# RUN nvm install --lts
----

Then press `Ctrl-P` and select "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container..."
from the menu.

This project uses the Unlicense but the resulting container images contain
